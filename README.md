# Odin Recipes
## Introduction
A very simple website containing cooking recipes. This was created with the intention of refreshing myself on basic HTML and CSS.
## Skills Reviewed
* Basic HTML document structure
* HTML tags such as `<ul>`,`<span>`, and `<img>`
* HTML attributes such as `class`, `href`, and `src`
* CSS selectors including class selector, `:hover`, and `:visited`
* CSS properties including `font-family`, `background-color`, and `box-shadow`
* CSS box model (`padding`, `border`, `margin`)
* CSS flexbox layout (`flex-grow`, `flex-basis`, `flex-direction`, `align-items`, etc.)
## TODO
* Utilize responsive CSS design on recipe pages (instead of just the homepage)
* Implement media queries for better responsive design
